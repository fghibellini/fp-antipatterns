# FP Antipatterns

This is a list of anti-patterns that I've personally encountered on the job working on Haskell and Purescript codebases.
All made by people who already knew how to write Haskell.

1. [Noop Inputs](./patterns/noop-inputs.md)
2. [Maybe-Encoded States](./patterns/maybe-encoded-states.md)
