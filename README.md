# FP Antipatterns

This is a list of anti-patterns that I've personally encountered on the job working on Haskell and Purescript codebases.
All made by people who already knew how to write Haskell.

1. [Noop Inputs](./patterns/noop-inputs.md)
2. [Maybe-Encoded States](./patterns/maybe-encoded-states.md)
3. [Exposing the Ingredients](./patterns/exposing-the-ingredients.md)
4. [Business logic in parsers](./patterns/business-logic-in-parsers.md)
5. [Same Input and Output](./patterns/same-input-and-output-type.md)
